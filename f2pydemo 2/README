This tutorial shows two examples of how to create dynamic libraries for
Python from Fortran procedures.  The tutorial itself in the the file
F2pyTutorial.pdf

The first example shows how to do this for cases that require no changes
to the Fortran or a minimal wrapper.  The second main code discusses a
strategy of how to handle the case of derived types in the Fortran.

There are 2 Fortran main codes in this tutorial, f2pydemo1.f90 and
f2pydemo2.f90, describing the original Fortran examples.

To compile these two programs, cut, paste and execute the contents of
the files fcompile1 and fcompiler, respectively, or execute:

./fcompile1 or ./fcompile2 or make

To create the dynamic libraries for Python from the Fortran examples,

cut, paste and execute the contents of the files pycompile1 and
pycompile2, respectively, or execute:

./pycompile1 or ./pycompile2 or make python

There are 2 Python scripts in this tutorial, f2pydemo1.py and
f2pydemo2.py which run the Python version of the Fortran main codes.

To run these Python examples, run:

python3 f2pydemo1.py or python3 f2pydemo2.py, respectively.
